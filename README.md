# MedLink — Clinic Appointment Management System

MedLink is a full-stack scheduling platform that streamlines communication between patients and doctors. Patients can discover available time slots, book or reschedule appointments, and track visit history. Doctors configure their availability, review upcoming visits, and monitor past appointments. Conflict detection prevents double-booking for both parties, and JWT-protected routes tailor the experience by role.

## Project Highlights

- **Role-based UX:** Patients and doctors see personalized dashboards once authenticated via JWT.
- **Availability-aware booking:** The frontend availability modal only presents time slots that are conflict-free for both the doctor _and_ the current patient.
- **Scheduling safeguards:** Bookings must be at least one hour in the future, and rescheduling enforces the same rules with immediate feedback.
- **Comprehensive history:** Patients filter historical appointments by date range, status (upcoming, completed, cancelled, no-show), and doctor.
- **Doctor tooling:** Doctors manage recurring availability, monitor upcoming visits, and audit past appointments from dedicated pages.
- **Hard cancelation:** Cancelling an appointment performs a hard delete so upcoming views stay uncluttered.

## Core Features

### Patient Experience
- Browse doctors and filtered availability slots.
- Book appointments with a modal time-slot picker (auto-calculates end time).
- Reschedule existing appointments without leaving the form.
- Cancel appointments with confirmation (records removed from upcoming list).
- Dashboard lists upcoming appointments soonest-first with quick reschedule/cancel actions.
- History page supports sort/pagination and multiple filters.

### Doctor Experience
- Manage weekly availability windows.
- Review upcoming appointments with patient metadata.
- Inspect past appointments (completed/cancelled/no-show).
- Routes are protected by doctor-role middleware.

### Security & Compliance
- JWT authentication and bcrypt password hashing.
- Custom Express middleware for authentication and role authorization.
- `.env` keeps secrets out of version control.
- No prohibited libraries (Axios, Mongoose, CORS middleware) per assignment rules.

## Technology Stack

| Layer      | Technologies |
|------------|--------------|
| Frontend   | React 18, React Router 6, Vite 5, PropTypes, component-scoped CSS |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express 4, MongoDB driver 6, jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, dotenv |
| Tooling    | ESLint, Prettier, npm scripts (dev/start/seed/cleanup) |
| Database   | MongoDB (Atlas or local) with `users`, `appointments`, `availability` collections |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ and npm (or yarn)
- MongoDB connection string (Atlas cluster or local instance)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # or create .env manually
```

`.env` example:
```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/clinic_appointments
JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-production
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

Seed and start the API:
```bash
npm run cleanup   # optional reset
npm run seed
npm start         # serves http://localhost:3001
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev       # serves http://localhost:3000 (Vite)
```

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
# Outputs static bundle to frontend/dist
```

---

## Database & Seed Data

Running `npm run seed` (backend) creates:
- 1 test patient (`emily@patient.com` / `password123`)
- 50 additional patients
- 15 doctors
- ~650 appointments (increase volume if the rubric requires ≥1000 records)

To reseed:
```bash
npm run cleanup
npm run seed
```

Collections used:
- **users** – stores patients and doctors (with role + specialty metadata)
- **appointments** – visit details with status lifecycle
- **availability** – doctor availability windows

Indexes include compound lookups on `patientId/startDateTime` and `doctorId/startDateTime` to support scheduling queries.

## Testing Guide

1. Start the backend and frontend (`npm start` / `npm run dev`).
2. Log in as the seeded patient (`emily@patient.com / password123`).
3. Use “Book Visit” to select a doctor and choose an available slot; confirm the booking.
4. Verify the new appointment appears at the top of `/patient/dashboard`.
5. Reschedule the appointment via the card’s quick action and confirm the updated time.
6. Cancel the appointment and ensure it disappears from the upcoming list.
7. Log in as a doctor (e.g., `doctor1@example.com / password123`) to edit availability and confirm the patient view updates.

---

## Quality & Tooling

- **Linting:** `.eslintrc.json` in both backend and frontend; run `npm run lint` (frontend) if desired.
- **Formatting:** `.prettierrc` ensures consistent styling; run Prettier before submission.
- **PropTypes:** Every React component exports PropTypes to document props.
- **No unused scaffolding:** Project structure trimmed to active components/routes.
- **Secrets:** `.env` is ignored; do not commit credentials.
